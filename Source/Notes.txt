Due to the implementation details, the mush matcher will find words not possible with the input characters, because it does not have enough of a specific type of letter to make the word. 
However, it is aware of how many letters it has and will not try to use more letters than it has
I think this problem is just something I will need to manually check for
After a match is found, the match is validated as conforming to the pattern, I probably need to just store the character counts of each letter

Im sure I could greatly improve some of the methods in the Mush class, there are a lot of loops.

I am very sloppy with all my file management, very little error checking or correction. 
I should go through and fix it all up, I want to be able to build this project.
This also applies to stuff like config files
